* Repolink

When you're too lazy to browse Github or Bitbucket to grab a link to a file/line
to share with a friend/colleague.

** Installation

Save ~repolink.el~ in your load path.

** Usage

Mark a region (or don't) in a file that's tracked by Git, then do
=M-x repolink RET=.  A link of the file to the remote repo (with the
marked region highlighted) will be added to the kill ring.

At the moment only Github and Bitbucket (Git only) is available.
